## INCIDENCE

Common worldwide (4th biggest cancer, 2nd biggest killer).  
Reducing in the West; used to be the highest killer; now about 1/3 what it was 35 years ago (possibly related to *H. pylori*).  
*Trend:* decreasing in the distal stomach, increasing at the cardia/GOJ, increase in diffuse type (represents about 30% of neoplasms).

**Geography:**  
Relatively low in the West; high in Southeast Asia, Japan (decreasing with Westernization), Russia, and South America.  
2–4× higher in Polynesians.

**Sex:**  
Approximately M2:F1.

**Age:**  
Mean age is in the 60s at discovery. Rare under 40 except in familial forms.

## AETIOLOGY

Gastric cancer is about 90% adenocarcinomas, with 10% being other types (mainly lymphoma or GIST). Occasionally, squamous cell carcinoma, oat cell carcinoma, carcinoid, or mesodermal tumors occur.

### AdenoCa Predisposing Factors

#### Genetic
- **Familial Gastric Cancer:**  
  1. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer  
     - Two or more cases in first/second-degree relatives; one diagnosed before age 50  
     - Three or more cases independent of age  
     - *E-cadherin* gene inactivating mutation (especially common in Māori)  
  2. Familial diffuse gastric cancer  
  3. Familial intestinal gastric cancer  

#### Inflammatory
Chronic gastritis is the usual background.  
- **H. pylori** is the main cause (3–4× risk if infected).  
  - Risk is proportionate to *H. pylori* serum levels.  
  - Leads to atrophy of the gastric mucosa (decreased acidity, increased bacterial overgrowth producing toxins) and is associated with pernicious anemia and chronic peptic ulcers.  
  - Though *H. pylori* is very significant, only about 1% are associated purely by virtue of chronic inflammatory change.

#### Nutritional
- Vitamin C deficiency  
- Low fruit and vegetable intake, high starch diet

#### Toxins
- Smoking  
- Dietary toxins (nitrosamines, possible polycyclic hydrocarbons, from dried, smoked, and salted food)

#### Iatrogenic
- Previous gastric surgery  
  - Approximately 2% risk of cancer at a gastroduodenal anastomosis  
  - Typically 15–20 years after surgery (young surgical patients are at risk)  
  - Chronic gastritis, atrophy, fundic gland polyps, and hyperplastic polyps are more common in the gastric remnant  
  - Both intestinal and diffuse types occur (about 40% early)

#### Other
- Also seen more in people with blood group A  
- Menetrier’s Disease (rare): Rugal hypertrophy and hyperplasia, hypochlorhydria, and protein-losing enteropathy; cancer occurs in about 10%, often diagnosed within 12 months of each other.

## BIOLOGICAL BEHAVIOUR

### Pathology

* **Adenocarcinoma:**  
  - **Lauren Classification:**  
    - *Intestinal*: Well differentiated (mucosal origin)  
    - *Diffuse*: Poorly differentiated (lamina propria origin)

1. **Intestinal** (approximately 20% 5‑year survival)  
   - Associated with chronic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and *H. pylori*.  
   - Typically well differentiated and expansile.  
   - More common in high‐risk populations (M > F 2:1; older patients; declining overall incidence).  
   - Tends to form glands and metastasizes via the bloodstream.

2. **Diffuse** are ominous (about 10% 5‑year survival)  
   - Lacks mucous-secreting elements; unclear cause; may be genetic or related to *H. pylori*.  
   - Typically poorly differentiated and infiltrative.  
   - More common in women and younger patients; may have a stronger genetic determination.  
   - Spreads via submucosal infiltration.

### Pathogenesis

_Classical development theorized as:_  
- *H. pylori* infection  
- Acute gastritis  
- Chronic active gastritis  
- Atrophic gastritis  
- Intestinal metaplasia  
- Dysplasia  
- Gastric cancer  

(Note: About 60–70% of mild-moderate dysplasia may revert to normal; severe dysplasia is much more likely to progress. This model applies mainly to the intestinal type.)

### Natural History

- Arises in the mucosa.  
- **Early Gastric Cancer:**  
  - Confined to the mucosa or submucosa regardless of lymph node involvement.  
  - 5‑year survival is good (≈90%) when detected early; however, early detection in the West is only around 10%.  
  - In Japan, screening with double-contrast barium meal and endoscopy leads to early detection (≈30%).  
  - Tumors less than 5 mm may be termed “minute”.  
  - Lymph node risk is <5% with mucosal disease; about 20% with submucosal invasion.  
  - Higher risk with ulceration and larger tumors.

- **Early Gastric Cancer Macroscopic Classification:**
  - **Type I:** Protuberant  
    - Sessile, smooth nodules with a broad stalk, often pale.
  - **Type II:** Superficial  
    - Variants: elevated, flat, or depressed.
  - **Type III:** Ulcerating  
    - Exophytic tumors have a better prognosis (often intestinal type); ulcerating tumors tend to be diffuse.

- **Location:**  
  - Most common in the antrum (40%); diffuse cancers of the proximal stomach (30%) are increasing in the West.  
  - Invasion into the duodenum is a poor prognostic sign (with 5‑year survival approaching 5%).

- **Spread:**  
  - Intramural, direct extraluminal growth, lymphatic, and distant metastases.  
  - Regional nodes are involved in at least 75% of cases at presentation.  
  - Intragastric spread is often more proximal than distal.  
  - The pylorus acts as a partial barrier (tumors may extend beyond in 25% of cases).  
  - Later, metastasis to the liver, bone, brain, and lung may occur.  
  - Advanced disease has a 5‑year survival rate below 15%.

- **Borrmann Classification (Subtypes):**  
  Four subdivisions correlate loosely with natural history and outcome (in order of increasing aggressiveness):  
  - *Type I:* Polypoid carcinomas – large, bulky intraluminal growths that tend to metastasize late; often soft and red.  
  - *Type II:* Ulcerating/excavated carcinoma – deep, penetrating ulcer-tumor with flat or rolled edges.  
  - *Type III:* Ulcerative with elevated margins (infiltrative).  
  - *Type IV:* Linitis plastica type – diffuse thickening of all layers with a marked desmoplastic reaction; cure is rare and advanced spread is common.

There is also a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (often associated with EBV) that has a relatively good prognosis.

### Genetics

- Disruption of the genome, involvement of oncogenes, and mutations in tumor-suppressor genes.  
- **p53** is the most common abnormality (involved in preserving genome stability).  
- If not p53, then microsatellite instability is typically seen.  
- **APC** and **DCC** genes are also commonly affected.  
- Reduced expression of **E-cadherin** (cellular adhesion molecule) is seen in about 90% of cases, especially in diffuse types.  
- Familial clustering can be observed in conditions like HNPCC and familial gastric cancer.

## MANIFESTATIONS

### Symptoms

**Local:**  
- Often asymptomatic when superficial and curable.  
- As the disease advances, symptoms may include:
  - Vague non-specific symptoms (e.g., early satiety, a sense of heaviness, pain that may not be obvious).
  - Severe, steady abdominal pain (often slight and sometimes relieved by food).

Additional local symptoms:  
- Anorexia (often with meat consumption), dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting (severe if near the pylorus), and altered bowel habits.  
- Less frequently, dysphagia (if the tumor involves the cardia).  
- Hemorrhage (haematemesis/melena) and perforation may also occur.

**General:**  
- Weight loss, loss of strength, and general malaise.  
- Frequently accompanied by anemia.

**Metastatic:**  
- Symptoms due to local spread involving lymph nodes, liver, bones, brain, or lung.

### Signs

**Observation:**  
- Jaundice, cachexia, and anemia.  
- Signs of metastasis may include abnormalities in the liver, bone, brain, or lung.  
- Associated conditions include dermatomyositis and acanthosis nigricans (thickened, hyperpigmented skin at flexures).

**Palpation:**  
- A palpable tumor usually indicates advanced disease.  
- Virchow’s node (left supraclavicular fossa) or Sister Mary Joseph nodule may be present.  
- A large liver or malignant ascites may be noted.  
- In advanced disease, Blumer’s shelf (pre-rectal metastases) may be palpable.

- Always consider metastases to the lungs, bone, and brain.

## INVESTIGATIONS

### Endoscopy
- Gastroscopic biopsy is the standard (with at least 6 biopsies for ulcers).  
- Gastric cancer ulcers are suspicious.  
- *Role of Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS):*  
  - Can demonstrate tumor depth (≈80% accuracy) and lymph node involvement (≈50% accuracy).  
  - Particularly useful for differentiating T2 tumors, which may need neoadjuvant chemotherapy and could be amenable to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) in specialized centers.

### Imaging
- Staging relies on CT scanning, EUS, and laparoscopy.  
- CT can reveal metastatic disease.  
- An abdominal X-ray (AXR) may show a rigid stomach (“leather bottle” appearance).  
- Double-contrast barium meal study is also used.
- **Staging Laparoscopy:**  
  - Highly advisable; usually performed as a day stay procedure.  
  - Can detect peritoneal metastatic disease in about 30% of patients with normal cross-sectional imaging.  
  - Collection of peritoneal washings is performed; a positive result predicts early peritoneal recurrence and, if negative (even without visible metastases), survival decreases from 98.5 months to 14.8 months.

### Role of PET
- Less useful in gastric cancer because many tumors are not FDG avid (only about 60% positive compared to ~90% in esophageal cancers).  
- More likely to be positive in intestinal-type tumors compared to diffuse/signet-ring types.

### Haematology
- Leucocytosis is possible.  
- Occult blood (FOB) test may be positive in about 50% of cases.

### Markers
- Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is positive in about 65% of cases, usually in those with extensive disease.

### Histology
- Dysplasia is generally divided into low-grade and high-grade based on cytological and architectural features.
  - Glandular differentiation is more favorable than diffuse type.  
  - Diffuse type often has a substantial stromal component.  
  - “Signet ring” type is poorly differentiated, more common in women and younger patients.  
  - Lymphovascular invasion is an important prognostic indicator.

### Staging

#### TNM Classification

**Tumor (T):**
- **Tx:** Unassessable
- **T0:** No primary tumor evident
- **Tis:** In situ (intraepithelial; not invading lamina propria)
- **T1:** Invades lamina propria or submucosa
- **T2:** Invades muscularis (T2a) or subserosa (T2b)
- **T3:** Invades serosa/visceral peritoneum (but not adjacent structures)
- **T4:** Invades adjacent structures

**Nodes (N):**
- **Nx:** Unassessable  
- **N0:** No regional nodes  
- **N1:** 1–6 regional nodes  
- **N2:** 7–15 nodes  
- **N3:** More than 15 nodes  
  _(At least 15 nodes should be present in the specimen for accurate staging.)_

**Metastases (M):**
- **Mx:** Unassessable  
- **M0:** No metastases  
- **M1:** Distant metastases

**Staging Summary:**

| Stage  | Description                            |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- |
| Tis    | In situ                                |
| IA     | T1N0M0                                 |
| IB     | T1N1M0 or T2a/bN0M0                     |
| II     | T1N2M0, T2N1M0, or T3N0M0                |
| IIIA   | T2N2M0, T3N1M0, or T4N0M0                |
| IIIB   | T3N2M0                                 |
| IV     | T4N1-3M0, T1-3N3M0, or any T, any N, M1   |

## MANAGEMENT

A multidisciplinary approach is essential, involving gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, and radiologists.

### Screening
- Conducted in Japan using mobile X-ray units and double-contrast studies, which have improved early diagnosis and survival rates.
- However, overall benefit is minimal and not sufficiently feasible for all dyspeptic patients.

### Surgical Principles
- Surgical excision remains the cornerstone of curative therapy.
- Only possible in less than 25% of cases.
- Aim for an **R0 resection** (clear margins) with radical lymphadenectomy and a 5 cm margin (due to submucosal spread).

*What to do with R1 resection?*  
- There is controversy; decision should be based on the patient's overall condition and treatment goals.  
- If the tumor is early, with good lymph node status, and the patient is fit for surgery, re-resection may be considered.

**Procedure:**  
See the [Gastrectomy](Gastrectomy.html) page for details.

**Role of Proximal Partial Gastrectomy:**  
- Generally avoided due to intractable reflux issues.

**Extent of Lymphadenectomy:**  
- **D0:** No nodes (palliative resection)  
- **D1:** Excision of perigastric nodes  
- **D2:** Excision of nodes along the trunks of the coeliac axis  
  - D2 resection is standard in Japan, where evidence supports its use, but many Western surgeons remain skeptical because of higher morbidity.  
  - Trials have shown mixed results regarding survival benefits versus higher complications when extended resections are performed.  
  - Aggressive lymphadenectomy helps with accurate staging and may improve survival if at least 15 nodes are examined.

**Neoadjuvant Therapy:**  
- More than one third of patients cannot tolerate postoperative chemotherapy; preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemo is better tolerated.  
- It allows for assessment of tumor response and downstaging.  
- The MAGIC trial demonstrated that perioperative chemotherapy (epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU) improved overall and progression-free survival as well as resectability.

**Prognosis:**  
- Refer to prognostic nomograms (e.g., from Cameron’s work) which consider: age, sex, primary tumor site, Lauren classification, size, nodal involvement, and depth of invasion.

**Palliation:**  
- For many elderly patients with advanced lymphatic spread, surgery is contraindicated.  
- Palliation focuses on relieving pain and dysphagia, and may include mild chemotherapy (e.g., 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin).  
- Gastric cancer is generally radioresistant, although radiotherapy can play a role in symptom palliation.
