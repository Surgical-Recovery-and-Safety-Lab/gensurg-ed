    "text": "3.3 AETIOLOGY\nGastric cancer is about 90% adenocarcinomas, with 10% being other types (mainly lymphoma or GIST). Occasionally, squamous cell carcinoma, oat cell carcinoma, carcinoid, or mesodermal tumors occur.\n\n3.3.1 AdenoCa Predisposing Factors\n\n3.3.1.1 Genetic\n\nFamilial Gastric Cancer:\n\nHereditary diffuse gastric cancer\n\nTwo or more cases in first/second-degree relatives; one diagnosed before age 50\n\nThree or more cases independent of age\n\nE-cadherin gene inactivating mutation (especially common in Māori)\n\n\nFamilial diffuse gastric cancer\n\nFamilial intestinal gastric cancer\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.2 Inflammatory\nChronic gastritis is the usual background.\n- H. pylori is the main cause (3–4× risk if infected).\n- Risk is proportionate to H. pylori serum levels.\n- Leads to atrophy of the gastric mucosa (decreased acidity, increased bacterial overgrowth producing toxins) and is associated with pernicious anemia and chronic peptic ulcers.\n- Though H. pylori is very significant, only about 1% are associated purely by virtue of chronic inflammatory change.\n\n\n3.3.1.3 Nutritional\n\nVitamin C deficiency\n\nLow fruit and vegetable intake, high starch diet\n\n\n\n3.3.1.4 Toxins\n\nSmoking\n\nDietary toxins (nitrosamines, possible polycyclic hydrocarbons, from dried, smoked, and salted food)\n\n\n\n3.3.1.5 Iatrogenic\n\nPrevious gastric surgery\n\nApproximately 2% risk of cancer at a gastroduodenal anastomosis\n\nTypically 15–20 years after surgery (young surgical patients are at risk)\n\nChronic gastritis, atrophy, fundic gland polyps, and hyperplastic polyps are more common in the gastric remnant\n\nBoth intestinal and diffuse types occur (about 40% early)\n\n\n\n\n3.3.1.6 Other\n\nAlso seen more in people with blood group A\n\nMenetrier’s Disease (rare): Rugal hypertrophy and hyperplasia, hypochlorhydria, and protein-losing enteropathy; cancer occurs in about 10%, often diagnosed within 12 months of each other.\n\nTop",

This model applies mainly to the intestinal type.)\n\n\n3.4.3 Natural History\n\nArises in the mucosa.\n\nEarly Gastric Cancer:\n\nConfined to the mucosa or submucosa regardless of lymph node involvement.\n\n5‑year survival is good (≈90%) when detected early; however, early detection in the West is only around 10%.\n\nIn Japan, screening with double-contrast barium meal and endoscopy leads to early detection (≈30%).\n\nTumors less than 5 mm may be termed “minute”.\n\nLymph node risk is &lt;5% with mucosal disease; about 20% with submucosal invasion.\n\nHigher risk with ulceration and larger tumors.\n\nEarly Gastric Cancer Macroscopic Classification:\n\nType I: Protuberant\n\nSessile, smooth nodules with a broad stalk, often pale.\n\nType II: Superficial\n\nVariants: elevated, flat, or depressed.\n\nType III: Ulcerating\n\nExophytic tumors have a better prognosis (often intestinal type); ulcerating tumors tend to be diffuse.\n\n\nLocation:\n\nMost common in the antrum (40%); diffuse cancers of the proximal stomach (30%) are increasing in the West.\n\nInvasion into the duodenum is a poor prognostic sign (with 5‑year survival approaching 5%).\n\nSpread:\n\nIntramural, direct extraluminal growth, lymphatic, and distant metastases.\n\nRegional nodes are involved in at least 75% of cases at presentation.\n\nIntragastric spread is often more proximal than distal.\n\nThe pylorus acts as a partial barrier (tumors may extend beyond in 25% of cases).\n\nLater, metastasis to the liver, bone, brain, and lung may occur.\n\nAdvanced disease has a 5‑year survival rate below 15%.\n\nBorrmann Classification (Subtypes):\nFour subdivisions correlate loosely with natural history and outcome (in order of increasing aggressiveness):\n\nType I: Polypoid carcinomas – large, bulky intraluminal growths that tend to metastasize late; often soft and red.\n\nType II: Ulcerating/excavated carcinoma – deep, penetrating ulcer-tumor with flat or rolled edges.\n\nType III: Ulcerative with elevated margins (infiltrative).\n\nType IV: Linitis plastica type – diffuse thickening of all layers with a marked desmoplastic reaction; cure is rare and advanced spread is common.\n\n\nThere is also a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (often associated with EBV) that has a relatively good prognosis.\n\n\n3.4.4 Genetics\n\nDisruption of the genome, involvement of oncogenes, and mutations in tumor-suppressor genes.\n\np53 is the most common abnormality (involved in preserving genome stability).\n\nIf not p53, then microsatellite instability is typically seen.\n\nAPC and DCC genes are also commonly affected.\n\nReduced expression of E-cadherin (cellular adhesion molecule) is seen in about 90% of cases, especially in diffuse types.\n\nFamilial clustering can be observed in conditions like HNPCC and familial gastric cancer.\n\nTop",

    "text": "3.7 MANAGEMENT\nA multidisciplinary approach is essential, involving gastroenterologists, surgeons, oncologists, and radiologists.\n\n3.7.1 Screening\n\nConducted in Japan using mobile X-ray units and double-contrast studies, which have improved early diagnosis and survival rates.\nHowever, overall benefit is minimal and not sufficiently feasible for all dyspeptic patients.\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Surgical Principles\n\nSurgical excision remains the cornerstone of curative therapy.\nOnly possible in less than 25% of cases.\nAim for an R0 resection (clear margins) with radical lymphadenectomy and a 5 cm margin (due to submucosal spread).\n\nWhat to do with R1 resection?\n- There is controversy; decision should be based on the patient’s overall condition and treatment goals.\n- If the tumor is early, with good lymph node status, and the patient is fit for surgery, re-resection may be considered.\nProcedure:\nSee the Gastrectomy page for details.\nRole of Proximal Partial Gastrectomy:\n- Generally avoided due to intractable reflux issues.\nExtent of Lymphadenectomy:\n- D0: No nodes (palliative resection)\n- D1: Excision of perigastric nodes\n- D2: Excision of nodes along the trunks of the coeliac axis\n- D2 resection is standard in Japan, where evidence supports its use, but many Western surgeons remain skeptical because of higher morbidity.\n- Trials have shown mixed results regarding survival benefits versus higher complications when extended resections are performed.\n- Aggressive lymphadenectomy helps with accurate staging and may improve survival if at least 15 nodes are examined.\nNeoadjuvant Therapy:\n- More than one third of patients cannot tolerate postoperative chemotherapy; preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemo is better tolerated.\n- It allows for assessment of tumor response and downstaging.\n- The MAGIC trial demonstrated that perioperative chemotherapy (epirubicin, cisplatin, 5-FU) improved overall and progression-free survival as well as resectability.\nPrognosis:\n- Refer to prognostic nomograms (e.g., from Cameron’s work) which consider: age, sex, primary tumor site, Lauren classification, size, nodal involvement, and depth of invasion.\nPalliation:\n- For many elderly patients with advanced lymphatic spread, surgery is contraindicated.\n- Palliation focuses on relieving pain and dysphagia, and may include mild chemotherapy (e.g., 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin).\n- Gastric cancer is generally radioresistant, although radiotherapy can play a role in symptom palliation.\nTop",
